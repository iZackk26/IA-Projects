# What is Face Spoof
Face spoof is a video that replicates or imitates another video or real-life event.

Face recognition systems are vulnerable to photographs and videos spoof, so
that why we need to build anti-spoof systems.

It analyzes the texture, structures, information, liveness and image quality.

Disadvantages:

1. Video/Replay can tresspass this kind of security
1. High image/videos quality can tresspass ass well

A study has found that using a termal sensor and the face recognition has more capabilities.

# Meanings
1. SVC = Support Vector Classifier => This is a model that should be supervised
   that clasify the problems into a label.

1. CIELUV = CIE => International Commission on Illumination => L U V, itÂ´s the
colorspace.It is a matheatical model that represents a human perception of color
at more accurately color spaces. 

1. YCbCr = It is a Luma(Y), Chroma Blue(Cb) and Chroma Red(Cr) color space.

1. MTCNN(Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network)
1. Convolutation Neural Network = Is a filter to an input that results in an activation.
