    Supervised Learning:
        Classification:
            It can be classify on two or more classes
        Regression:
            The goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on input features, for example predict the price of a house based on the doors, floor, and furniture provided.

    # The purpose of this is that the algorithym generalizes well unseen and new data.

    Unsupervised Learning
        The purpose of this training method is to train a model with a dataset, without any informacion of outputs or inputs.
        * Clustering:
            Group similar datasets, that have similar behavior.
        * Asociation:
            It searchs for similar patterns in the datasets that describe relationships between another datasets.
            Ej:
                If you buy bread, might buy some butter.
